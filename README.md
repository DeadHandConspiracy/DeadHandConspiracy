- Hi, Iâ€™m @DeadHandConspiracy but I have gone by many different names.  I hold a BS in electrical engineer from a HBCU.

- I'm currently working on a few projects:
1) A nature webcam 
2) Variable power regulator board raspberry pi
3) building a battlebot

- How to reach me ... I don't know if it's possible. I don't really like social media.
